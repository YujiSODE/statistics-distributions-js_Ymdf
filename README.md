###Cited from [statistics-distributions-js (Ben Tilly,2008)](https://code.google.com/archive/p/statistics-distributions-js/);
This library calculates percentage points (5 significant digits) of the u (standard normal) distribution, the student's t distribution, the chi-square distribution and the F distribution. It can also calculate the upper probability (5 significant digits) of the u (standard normal), the chi-square, the t and the F distribution.

These critical values are needed to perform statistical tests, like the u test, the t test, the F test and the chi-squared test, and to calculate confidence intervals.

This is a direct port of the Perl module Statistics::Distributions.
